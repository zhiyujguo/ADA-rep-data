The replication data can be found here through this google drive [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13XSz7e1xYjj94XRmLIQVTGVmQ6qND0Ov?usp=drive_link). There are two files, one contains the 2015 dataset with all the original data from API including the original post title, post content, and our outcomes of interest. The other consists of the covariates, the gender indicator (treatment), and the outcomes of interest (the number of upvotes and comments) after pre-processing and our text representation steps, labeled as "cov_15.csv."
